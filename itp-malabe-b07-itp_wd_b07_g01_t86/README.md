#### Brief Description of Project - 
Through this project, an automated computerized system for Samod Construction has been developed.
Earlier, Samod Construction has been using a manual system to manage their construction work. The construction management system started upscaling their business and they realized that using a manual system has been difficult, unproductive, and inefficient. Therefore, through this project, an automated computerized system is implemented under eight major functions that cover the complete scope of the construction.
These functions are Account Management, Package management, Customer management, Finance management, Human Resource Management, Site management, Equipment management, and Transportation management.
This automated computerized system overcomes issues with manual systems such as less security. Long access time, no database, and difficulty to make changes.
As development technology for this system, MERN STACK is used.
Access control security, easy data management, and a user-friendly interface are provided to the stakeholders through this system.



#### Technologies used - 
For our project, we decided to use the MERN stack that includes React for the front-end, Node JS and Express JS for the back-end framework, and Mongo DB for the database server, as it is a popular and easy-to-use web stack, especially for a team new to web development.

The web application was developed using the MERN software stack. MongoDB was used as the Database which is a NoSQL database. Express was used as the framework to build the back end of the web application while Node.js was used as the runtime server environment. Finally, the React.js was used to implement the application's front end and the Visual Studio Code was used as the Code editor. In addition to the above technologies, CSS, Tailwind, Ant design, and Font Awesome libraries were used for the user interface design. Also, we used POSTMAN for project backend testing purposes. jsPDF and jsPDF autotable libraries were used for the Report generation.
